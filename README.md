# 🎁 Wishlist Manager

> A simple, elegant solution for gift coordination that eliminates duplicate presents and makes celebrations stress-free.

## The Problem

We've all been there:
- Two people buy the same gift for someone's birthday
- You want to give a great gift but don't know what they want
- Coordinating with family and friends about who's buying what becomes a messy group chat
- The birthday person has to pretend they're excited about their third coffee maker

**Gift-giving should bring joy, not coordination headaches.**

## The Solution

Wishlist Manager is a straightforward wishlist application that solves gift duplication through a simple reservation system. Create wishlists for different events, share them with friends and family, and let people reserve gifts - ensuring everyone gets exactly what they want, with no duplicates.

## ✨ Key Features

### For Wishlist Owners
- 🎯 **Create Multiple Events** - Separate wishlists for birthdays, weddings, holidays, or any celebration
- 🎁 **Add Gift Ideas** - Build your wishlist with names, descriptions, and links
- 🔗 **Easy Sharing** - Get a unique shareable link for each event
- 👀 **Track Reservations** - See which gifts have been reserved (without knowing who reserved them)

### For Gift Givers
- 📋 **Browse Wishlists** - View all available gifts for an event
- 🔒 **Reserve Gifts** - Claim a gift so others know it's taken
- 🎨 **Clean Interface** - Simple, beautiful design that works on any device
- 🚫 **No Duplicates** - Reserved gifts are clearly marked to prevent overlap

## 🎯 Perfect For

- Birthday celebrations
- Weddings and engagements
- Baby showers
- Holiday gift exchanges
- Graduations
- Any celebration where gifts are involved
